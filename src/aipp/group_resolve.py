"""
Group-level conflict resolution for cysteine clusters.

Goal:
- Decide a single label for each group by "consensus-by-count" (CB).
- Add a parameter `novote_sources`: sources that stay in the group but
  do not cast TRUE/FALSE votes.

Key ideas:
- Records from `novote_sources` are included in the output and inherit the
  final group label, but they do not affect the vote counts.
- Optional `prioritize_sources` can force a group TRUE if any of those
  sources vote TRUE.
- Separate minimum-source requirements for positive and negative calls.

Terminology:
- "TRUE" / "FALSE" are member labels that count toward voting.
- "MASK" means we could not confidently call TRUE or FALSE.

      cb_rule_pos:
        Tuple (op, threshold) for positive voting. Example: (">=", 2).

      cb_rule_neg:
        Optional (op, threshold) for negative voting. If None, use the
        positive rule for negatives too.

      prioritize_sources:
        Set of source codes; if any of these has a TRUE record, the group
        becomes TRUE immediately.

      novote_sources:
        Set of source codes whose records DO NOT vote (but remain members).

      min_src_per_pos / min_src_per_neg:
        Minimum number of distinct voting sources required to call TRUE
        or FALSE, respectively. If unmet, result is "MASK".

      Notes:
        - 'label' âˆˆ {True, False, "MASK"} based on the CB rules.
        - Members from `novote_sources` do not contribute to true/false
          counts, but they inherit the group's final label.
